The ACML 2020 organizing committee invites proposals for workshops to be held at the conference on Sunday November 18th 2020 online and at the conference in Bangkok, Thailand.

The conference aims at providing a leading international forum for researchers in machine learning and related fields to share new results, ideas and discuss emerging topics.

We invite proposals for workshops on machine learning and related fields. Joint tutorial-workshop proposals are also highly encouraged.

A workshop proposal should include the following:

- Title and abstract
- Overview and outline of the workshop (2.5 hours)
- Secured and potential invited speakers
- Previous experience organizing a workshop (if any)
- Brief bio of organizers

Proposals and questions should be submitted to workshop co-chairs Prachya Boonkwan, NECTEC ([prachya.boonkwan@nectec.or.th](mailto:prachya.boonkwan@nectec.or.th)) and Taiji Suzuki, University of Tokyo ([taiji@mist.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp](mailto:taiji@mist.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp)).
