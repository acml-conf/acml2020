The ACML Steering Committee (SC) decided to establish the ACML Distinguished Contribution Award from 2018. More details about the policy can be seen at http://www.acml-conf.org/Award.ashx.

## The Award

The awardee will be invited to attend the conference of that year and give a 10 minutes' talk (not necessarily technical) at the banquet. They will also receive travel support, an award and a plaque (with name carved).

## Eligibility

1. Steering Committee voting members cannot be nominated for the award.
2. The awardee must have significant relationship with ACML, e.g.,

    - 2+ times as area chair, other chairs, or
    - 4+ times as program committee member, or
    - 5+ papers published in ACML, or
    - ...

   These are just examples, and the significance is to be judged by the award committee.
3. This is a premium award of machine learning in the geographical scope of ACML, and thus, the nominee should be well-known within the ACML community.
