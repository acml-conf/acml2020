For the conference track please submit your manuscript via CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2020. When creating a new submission on CMT, please make sure to choose **Conference** track.

Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this.

You can download a suitable Latex template and style files from [ACML2020-PMLR-template.20200129.zip](pathPrefix::/files/ACML2020-PMLR-template.20200129.zip).

All conference track submissions must be anonymized. Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g. in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission.
