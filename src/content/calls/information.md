The 12th Asian Conference on Machine Learning, Bangkok, Thailand (ACML 2020) aims to provide a leading international forum for researchers in machine learning and related fields to share their new ideas, progress and achievements. Submissions from regions other than the Asia-Pacific are also highly encouraged. It is planned to take place during November 18-20, 2020 in Bangkok, Thailand, and is co-located with ICONIP2020. The conference calls for high-quality, original research papers in the theory and practice of machine learning. The conference also solicits proposals focusing on frontier research, new ideas and paradigms in machine learning.

ACML has taken place annually since 2009 in locations throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The series of the conferences were held in Nagoya, Japan (2019), Beijing, China (2018), Seoul, Korea (2017), Hamilton, New Zealand (2016), Hong Kong, China (2015), Nha Trang, Vietnam (2014), Canberra, Australia (2013), Singapore (2012), Taoyuan, Taiwan (2011), Tokyo, Japan (2010), and Nanjing, China (2009). As usual, the committee plans to execute two publication tracks this year: Authors may submit either to the conference track, for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR) series, or to the journal track for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer journal Machine Learning.
