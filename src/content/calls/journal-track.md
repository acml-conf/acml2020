In addition to the Conference Track, the Asian Conference on Machine Learning will be running a Journal Track. In order to ensure an efficient reviewing process, we encourage submissions of papers up to 20 pages including all content and references. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published.

For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: [https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994](https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994).

The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The Journal Track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year's conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year's conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal.

For this year's journal track, <ins>the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two systems</ins> for the purpose of review management. <ins>This is very important, and failure to do so will result in automatic withdrawal from reviewing.</ins>

First, please <ins>submit the abstract via CMT</ins> at: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2020](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2020).

*When creating a new submission on CMT, please make sure to choose "Journal" track*.

Then, please <ins>submit the paper via Springer's Editorial Manager system</ins> at:
[https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach](https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach).

*When creating a new submission on Springer's Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose "S.I. : ACML 2020" as the article type.*

Journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authorsâ€™ identities will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g. in arXiv).
