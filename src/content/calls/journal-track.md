In addition to the Conference Track, the Asian Conference on Machine Learning will be running a Journal Track. In order to ensure an efficient reviewing process, we encourage submissions of papers up to 20 pages. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published.
For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994.

The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The Journal Track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year's conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year's conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal.
