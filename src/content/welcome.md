**The 12th Asian Conference on Machine Learning, Bangkok, Thailand (ACML 2020)** aims to provide a leading international forum for researchers in machine learning and related fields to share their new ideas, progress and achievements.

**COVID-19 Planning:** Â We remain optimistic that ACML 2020 will proceed as planned in Bangkok in November. However, given the current fluidity of the situation, we cannot at this time predict what will happen.Â  We assure you that we are planning for every eventuality and following how other conferences are dealing with it. Â  Regardless, ACML will proceed one way or another, so we look forward to your submissions. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Moreover, there will be an option for remote or recorded presentation, and there will be a registration option for online participation with commensurate reduced registration fees.</span>

Submissions from regions other than the Asia-Pacific are also highly encouraged. It is planned to take place during **November 18-20, 2020 in Bangkok, Thailand**, and is co-located with ICONIP2020. The conference calls for high-quality, original research papers in the theory and practice of machine learning.
