> Tom was a founding member of the steering committee of the Asian Conference on Machine Learning. As a steering committee member, he helped chart the successful growth of the conference, and was instrumental in connecting ACML to the wider machine learning community, particularly in North America. He gave insightful keynote talks at ACML and is always inspiring junior members of the community at the conference. He has added substantial vibrancy to the machine learning community in this region. Tom stepped down from the steering committee last year but the foundation that he helped to set will continue to serve the conference well — **Prof. Wee Sun Lee, ACML Distinguished Contribution Award Commitee**
